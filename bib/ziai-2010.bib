  abstract = {Corpora in linguistics and computational linguistics have traditionally
	been assembled from data sources such as newspaper texts, books and,
	more recently, the web. While these sources provide large quantities
	of language data, typically very little or nothing is known about
	the context under which the text has been produced. The only information
	an analysis can refer to is the text itself, e.g., when a sentence
	is analyzed using the preceding sentences for disambiguation. However,
	language is always produced in a concrete extra-linguistic context.
	This contextual setting includes world knowledge and situational
	knowledge, i.e., the aspects of world knowledge which are relevant
	to interpret the given text and the concrete task and situation that
	the language was produced for. The notion of a task and the evaluation
	of language in context plays a particularly important role in foreign
	language teaching and learning (cf., e.g., Ellis 2003) and a representation
	of the learner's ability to use language in context and to perform
	tasks using appropriate task strategies has been argued to be crucial
	for learner modeling (Amaral and Meurers 2008). However, the so-called
	learner corpora created to document the language produced by language
	learners typically consist only of learner essays. In this paper,
	we present our efforts at collecting a longitudinal learner corpus
	consisting of the answers to reading comprehension questions, including
	an explicit representation of the task context and learner information.
	After introducing the data sources and characteristics of the corpus
	we are collecting, we discuss the development of the open-source
	WELCOME tool, which we have created to facilitate the interdisciplinary
	exchange of the contextualized learner corpus between the language
	programs providing the data and the computational linguists working
	on its encoding and automatic analysis.},
