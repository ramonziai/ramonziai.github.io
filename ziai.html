 Compiling a task-based corpus for the analysis of learner language in
  context.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Corpora in linguistics and computational linguistics have traditionally
	been assembled from data sources such as newspaper texts, books and,
	more recently, the web. While these sources provide large quantities
	of language data, typically very little or nothing is known about
	the context under which the text has been produced. The only information
	an analysis can refer to is the text itself, e.g., when a sentence
	is analyzed using the preceding sentences for disambiguation. However,
	language is always produced in a concrete extra-linguistic context.
	This contextual setting includes world knowledge and situational
	knowledge, i.e., the aspects of world knowledge which are relevant
	to interpret the given text and the concrete task and situation that
	the language was produced for.
	
	
	The notion of a task and the evaluation of language in context plays
	a particularly important role in foreign language teaching and learning
	(cf., e.g., Ellis 2003) and a representation of the learner's ability
	to use language in context and to perform tasks using appropriate
	task strategies has been argued to be crucial for learner modeling
	(Amaral and Meurers 2008). However, the so-called learner corpora
	created to document the language produced by language learners typically
	consist only of learner essays.
	
	
	In this paper, we present our efforts at collecting a longitudinal
	learner corpus consisting of the answers to reading comprehension
	questions, including an explicit representation of the task context
	and learner information. After introducing the data sources and characteristics
	of the corpus we are collecting, we discuss the development of the
	open-source WELCOME tool, which we have created to facilitate the
	interdisciplinary exchange of the contextualized learner corpus between
	the language programs providing the data and the computational linguists
	working on its encoding and automatic analysis.

 A flexible annotation-based architecture for intelligent language
  tutoring systems.
 Master's thesis, Universit&auml;t T&uuml;bingen, Seminar f&uuml;r
  Sprachwissenschaft, April 2009.
[&nbsp;<a href="ziai_bib.html#Ziai-09">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
This thesis presents a general architecture for Intelligent Language
	Tutoring
	
	Systems. The architecture makes use of annotation-based processing
	to encode
	
	different linguistic information at deep and shallow levels in a flexible
	
	manner and associate it with the learner input string. At the same
	time, it
	
	leaves the original input untouched, which is different from traditional
	
	pipeline approaches used in other Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language
	
	Learning systems. We show that this is necessary in order for feedback
	to be
	
	both error-specific and useful to the learner.
	
	
	Furthermore, the architecture incorporates a general mechanism for
	the use of
	
	activity models in guiding processing and feedback. The approach uses
	error types as a
	
	means of formulating pedagogical goals of individual activities. These
	error
	
	types are then mapped to analysis requirements that can be used to
	adapt
	
	processing of the learner input to the activity. More importantly,
	error types
	
	are used to influence the feedback strategy towards the errors that
	a particular
	
	activity centers on. We also demonstrate a similar use of error counts
	in the
	
	learner model to guide feedback.
	
	
	We have evaluated the system on the basis of example scenarios. They
	show that
	
	we are indeed able to give more useful feedback than the baseline
	system
	
	TAGARELA (Amaral, 2007) in a number of cases. This is the result of
	both
	
	annotation-based processing and integration of activity and learner
	model into
	
	the feedback process.
